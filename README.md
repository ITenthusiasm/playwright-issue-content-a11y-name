# Playwright Issue Content A11y Name

Exemplifies Playwright's bug with deriving accessible names for elements using `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements.

The failing test case(s) can be found in [example.test.ts](./example.test.ts). To run the test(s), simply run `npx playwright test --ui`. (Or, if you don't want to run the tests in UI mode, then simply run `npx playwright test` instead.)
